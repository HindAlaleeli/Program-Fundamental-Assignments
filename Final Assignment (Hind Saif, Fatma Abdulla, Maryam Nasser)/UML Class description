Relationships
User – Account (Composition)
A User is the “whole” that owns exactly one Account; if a User is deleted, their Account no longer exists.
Relationship type: Composition (the part “Account” cannot exist independently without the whole “User”).
Notation: Filled diamond on the User side.
Multiplicity Notations:
User side: 1 → each User must have one Account
Account side: 1 → each Account belongs to exactly one User

Account – Booking (Composition)
An Account “owns” its Bookings; if an Account (whole) is deleted, all its Bookings (part) are deleted.
Relationship type: Composition (Strong Whole-Part Relationship).
Notation: Filled diamond at the Account end.
Multiplicity Notations:
Account side: 1 → an Account must exist to have Bookings
Booking side: 0..* → an Account can have zero or many Bookings

Booking – Ticket (Composition)
Each Booking (whole) generates exactly one Ticket (part)  which cannot exist without its Booking.
Relationship type: Composition
Notation: Filled diamond at the Booking end.
Multiplicity Notations:
Booking side: 1 → must have one Ticket
Ticket side: 1 → belongs to exactly one Booking


Booking – Payment (Composition)
A Booking is the “whole” that owns exactly one Payment; if a Booking is removed, its Payment does not exist.
Relationship type: Composition (the part “Payment” cannot exist independently of its whole “Booking”).
Notation: Filled diamond on the Booking side.
Multiplicity Notations:
Booking side: 1 → each Booking must have one Payment
Payment side: 1 → each Payment belongs to exactly one Booking


Ticket –  TicketType (Composition)
A Ticket is the “whole” that owns exactly one TicketType “part” ; if a Ticket is deleted, its TicketType part cannot exist.
Relationship type: Composition 
Notation: Filled diamond on the Ticket side.
Multiplicity Notations:
Ticket side: 1 → each Ticket must have one TicketType
TicketType side: 1 → each TicketType (as used by this Ticket) belongs to exactly one Ticket

TicketType – {SingleRace, WeekendPackage, SeasonMembership, GroupDiscount} (Inheritance)
TicketType is abstract, its four subclasses inherit its attributes and must implement their own version of calculatePrice().
Relationship type: Inheritance “is- a relationship” (Generalization)
Notation: Unfilled triangle arrow pointing to TicketType.

Ticket – Event (Association)
A Ticket is issued for exactly one Event; each Event may have many Tickets sold.
Relationship type: Association “has-a relationship”.
Multiplicity Notations:
Ticket side: 1 → exactly one Event
Event side: 0..* → zero or many Tickets

Event – VenueService (Aggregation)
An Event is the “whole” that aggregates zero or more VenueServices “part”, but each VenueService can exist independently of any particular Event.
Relationship type: Aggregation (weak whole–part).
Notation: Unfilled diamond on the Event side.
Multiplicity Notations:
Event side: 1 → each Event may aggregate multiple services
VenueService side: 0..* → a service can belong to zero or many Events

Administrator – {Booking, Event} (Association)
An Administrator can view and update zero or many Booking and Event records.
Relationship type: Association (has- a relationship).
Multiplicity:
Administrator side: 1 → each Administrator may manage multiple Bookings and Events
Booking side: 0..* → a Booking may be managed by zero or many Administrators
Event side: 0..* → an Event may be managed by zero or many Administrators
